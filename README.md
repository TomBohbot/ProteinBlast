Potein Blast
====

Protein Blast is a web application that can determine whether a particular DNA strand
matches any part of the DNA sequences that could encode a protein in a well-known set.

The web app returns the matching genome, protein, and start and end position of where
the subsequence was found in the proteinâ€™s sequence, and displays previous queries in 
the home page.

To be able to find if a DNA strand matches we use blastx which is a commandline in
biopython.

Protein Blast uses 10 genomes as its database which are (NC_016072 replaced NC_023640 in NCBI):
NC_000852, NC_007346, NC_008724, NC_009899, NC_014637, NC_020104, NC_023423, NC_016072, NC_023719, NC_02786

Try it using Docker
-------------------

To start the Protein Blast server:

    docker build -t protein-blast . && docker run -p 5000:5000 protein-blast

Then check it out in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ .

Once you are in the website you can input any DNA sequence and see the protein
match if it exists.
